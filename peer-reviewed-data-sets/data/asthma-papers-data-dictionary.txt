Data dictionary for asthma-papers

One or more occurences of the letter X in a field is a code for
missing or not applicable.

author, last name of first author. Remove half of any hyphenated 
  or two part last name.
  
da, Classification of the resource. Was the resource a raw dataset?
  RA=raw dataset
  SD=summary dataset
  CO=confidential, please contact the author
  
A raw dataset has information on distinct individuals, animals, cell
cultures, etc. A summary dataset aggregates information across
multiple individuals. It uses statistics like means, standard 
deviations, counts, or percentages. There is not always a clear
dividing line between the two.

If there is more than one resource, code as RA if at least one of the
resources is a raw dataset. Otherwise, code as SD otherwise.

Try to find original publication and review it.

pr, was the dataset associated with a peer-reviewed publication?
  PR=peer-reviewed publication found and reviewed
  BL=broken link
  FL=peer-reviewed publication found but in a foreign language
  PW=peer-reviewed publication found but behind a paywall
  NP=publication not peer-reviewed, such as a pre-print
  NF=no publication found

This field should not be coded as missing (XX).

If a peer-reviewed publication was found and reviewed, code the date of
publication and look for a data availability statement and a link in 
the paper back to figshare.

yyyy, year of publication. Please use a four digit year. If you cannot
  find the publication, code as XXXX.

mm, month of publication. Include a leading zero for month 01 (January)
  through 09 (September). If no month is given or you can't find the 
  publication, code as XX.
  
da, date of publication. Include a leading zero for dates 01 through 09.
  If no date is given or you can't find the publication, code as XX.
  
a, did the publication include a data availablity statement?
  M=no, data availablity statement missing
  C=yes, but data was not owned by authors
  Q=yes, but statement was questionable
  S=yes, but you have to ask for the data
  Y=yes, and statement was accurate
  P=yes, and privacy concerns prevented data sharing
  X=did not look for data availability statement
  
Note to myself. Go back and look at all the C values. Some of
these represent "not owned" but others represent "confidential"

l, did the publication include a link back to figshare?
  Y=yes, the publication mentioned figshare and included the link.
  O=linked to a resource other than figshare
  A=ambiguous, the publication mentioned figshare but without a link.
  D=discrepancy in list in Figshare versus the publication
  N=no, the publication did not mention figshare.
  X=did not look for a link back to figshare
